# ParallaxStickyHeaders
Implementing sticky headers on scroll down using JQuery and Skeleton CSS

The idea of this experiment is to create a WebSite that will use different headers and stick them to the top of the page as it is being scrolled down.

Base CSS -> Skeleton

JS -> Jquery and bespoke functions

Room to improvement
as the project stands, it is possible to extended the number of sections by assigning IDs to the different Divs and modifying the Jquery code to add a new section controller by only modifying the IDs the code is pointing to. Dynamically Identifying the section on screen to use as a next header is pending.
